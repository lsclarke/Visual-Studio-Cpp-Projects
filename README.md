# Visual Studio | C++ Projects

This folder contains all my relavant projects I have developed in the C++ coding language. After taking courses online and obataining my certification in C++ I wanted to push myself in areas I normally wouldn't. In this folder you will find a wide variety of projects that show off my skills as a developer and programmer in the C++ language ranging from console applications, GUI projects and even Unreal Engine 5 projects. Please feel free to test out these applications for yourself and even give me feed back as well. I always strive to learn, and better myself. That is the point of programming to always strive for efficientcy and optimization even as you read this I am learning new skills and working on new projects everyday to better my skills as a C++ Developer!
