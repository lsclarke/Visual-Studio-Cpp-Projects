<p dir="auto">This folder contains all my relevant projects I have developed in the C++ coding language. After taking courses online and obtaining my certification in C++ I wanted to push myself in areas I normally wouldn't. In this folder you will find a wide variety of projects that show off my skills as a developer and programmer in the C++ language ranging from **_CONSOLE APPLICATIONS_** to **_GUI PROJECTS_**. Please feel free to test out these applications for yourself and even give me feedback as well. I always strive to learn, and better myself. That is the point of programming to always strive for efficiency and optimization even as you read this. I am learning new skills and working on new projects everyday to better my skills as a C++ Developer!</p>
