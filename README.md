# Visual Studio | C++ Projects

This folder contains all my relavant projects I have developed in the C++ coding language. After taking courses online and obataining my certification in C++ I wanted to push myself in areas I normally wouldn't. In this folder you will find a wide variety of projects that show off my skills as a developer and programmer in the C++ language ranging from console applications, GUI projects and even Unreal Engine 5 projects. Please feel free to test out these applications for yourself and even give me feed back as well. I always strive to learn, and better myself. That is the point of programming to always strive for efficientcy and optimization even as you read this I am learning new skills and working on new projects everyday to better my skills as a C++ Developer!

Weapon Inventory System Console Application:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a C++ project that I have been working on for a couple of months. I was really interested in creating a weapons inventory system that could be helpful for keeping better track of equipment for military purposes or for a store inventory system. This console application I developed has 4 main functions: **READ**, **ADD**, **REMOVE**, **UPDATE**. I wanted to create an application that would allow users to take data from mySQL Workbench into this application for those to edit the file and then be able to reupload it to their workbench! This was a bit of a passion project because I took the time to do research on the best ways to go about approaching this. This also really helped me develop better problem solving skills and to further my skills as a C++ developer!

Features:

- READ allows the user to view/display data from a data file for review to see the invetory list.
- ADD allows the user to add new data to a copy data file that can be updated to the main file.
- Remove allows the user to remove data from the inventory file that can be updated to the main file.
- Update allows the user to update the main data file from the copy inventory data file.
